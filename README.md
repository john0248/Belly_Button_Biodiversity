# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

Scientist across the country have raced to find alternate ways to synthesizing beef.  Items like algae, fungi, and microorganisms.  Roza our head scientist is working on a way to synthesizing beef from bacteria found on the human body.  Since the body has many different types of bacteria, Rosa is focusing her study on the bacteria found specifically in the belly button. The data she has collected will be displayed below in various types of charts for your reference. 

## Charts 

We were able to pull together 3 main charts that adjust data based on the test subjects ID number (Test Subject ID No.). The first graph is a horizontal bar graph displaying the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the sample from the belly button. Below the bar graph you will find a bubble graph.  This bubble graph changes sizes based on the sample_values and color based on the bacteria ids.  The final graph is the gauge chart which displays the weekly washing frequency value.  Both the bubble and bar graph have text which will provide additional information when you hover over the data point. 

## Displaying Data

This dashboard was created using the following: Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Plotly.  To aide any user wanting to view Roza's dashboard, the html code is deployed through GitHub Pages.  The dashboard was customized by adding a background picture, custom font coloring and a short description of why we are sampling the belly button bacteria.
